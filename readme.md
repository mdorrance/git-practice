## Introduction to Git (lecture)

#### What is Git?

* Version control system
* Provides "multiple save points"

#### How is Git Configured on My Computer? 

* `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
* `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

Dotfiles: 
* .gitconfig
* .bash_profile

Don't have dotfiles? Check out Turing's [Bootstrapping New Students](https://github.com/turingschool/bootstrap_new_students) repository. 

#### What is Github? 

* Web-based Git repository hosting system

## Git in Practice

We'll walk through the steps of initializing a git repository, adding files, and committing them using the following basic workflow:

After initializing a Git repository...
* create and/or change one or more files
* `git add <filename>` add the file to the staging area
* `git commit -m 'some message about what you changed'` commit your changes

Repeat!

#### Initialize a Git Repository

* `mkdir intro_git`
* `cd intro_git`
* `touch Readme.md`
* `git init` initializes your current directory as a git repository. This allows the files to be tracked. 
* `git status` shows you what is tracked, untracked, and changed. `Readme.md` should be red since it is untracked.
* `git add Readme.md` adds the specified file to the staging area.
* `git status` shows you the current status. `Readme.md` should be green since it's been added. 
* `git commit -m 'initial commit'` commits your file with a message of 'initial commit'. 
* `git status` (to see clean working branch) shows the current status. The working branch should be clean and you should not see any red or green files.

#### Edit Files in Repository

* `atom .` Open your files in your text editor. 
* use atom to create two files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`)
* edit the `Readme.md`

* `git status` should show three red files. One has uncommitted changes and the other two are untracked.
* `git diff Readme.md` will show you the difference between the current state of the Readme.md file and the last committed version.
* `git add Readme.md`
* `git commit -m '(message about changing) Readme.md'`
* `git status`
* `git add file1.txt`
* `git status`
* `git add file2.txt`
* `git commit` This will open up your text editor and ask for a commit message. When finished, save and close the file. 

#### Working on Branches

* What is a branch?
* Why would you use a branch?
* [This link](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) shows some helpful visuals related to git branches.

* `git checkout -b feature1`
* edit all three files
* `git status`
* `git diff file1.txt`
* `git add file1.txt`
* `git status`
* `git diff file2.txt`
* `git checkout file2.txt` to discard changes (explain this checkout is different from checking out a branch)
* `git status`
* `git diff Readme.md`
* `git add Readme.md`
* `git commit -m '(message about changing two files)'`

#### Merging Branches

* `git checkout master`
* Take a look at the files in your editor. All of the changes are gone! (well, not really -- they're just in our other branch)
* `git merge feature1` will merge your commits from feature1 branch into master

#### Looking back at previous versions 

* `git log`
* `git show SHA:path/to/file.rb` shows the file at that point in time
* press return to scroll through a long output
* type `q` to get back to command prompt when looking at a long output
* `git show SHA` shows the diff to that file at that specific commit
	
#### Github

* create a new repo on Github -- find the `+` button in the top right corner
* public vs. private (paid) repositories
* initializing from command line vs. initializing from Github
* after clicking "create repository" button, follow instructions

#### Pushing Ruby Exercises to Own Github Account

* create new repo on Github and name it `ruby-exercises`
* `git push origin master` doesn't work. Why? 
* reset the `origin` point with `git remote rm origin`
* add the new origin using the command from Github: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/ruby-exercises`
* git push origin master
* you will still have all of the commits associated with this repository

## Independent Practice

If you're brand new to git, start with [Try Github](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

If you've used git before (or if you complete try.github), work through [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/). Atlassian also has a helpful [Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository).

And, if you just can't get enough Git, check out the [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book).
